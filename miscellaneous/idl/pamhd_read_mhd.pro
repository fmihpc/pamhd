; Fills variable_names and variable_descriptions with
; comma-separated names and descriptions of variables
; stored in given file.
;
; Fills data_field with an array of arrays of MHD data,
; data_field[0:*, N] is simulation data of N+1th cell stored in file.
;
; Fills meta_data with simulation time, adiabatic index,
; proton mass and vacuum premeability.
;
; If given sort_data returned data is sorted in ascending order
; by rz then items with identical rz are sorted by ry and items
; with identical rz and ry are sorted by rx.
;
; Returns 0 on success, > 0 on failure
