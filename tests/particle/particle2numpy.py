If called as the main program creates empty dictionaries bulk_data
and particle_data and fills them by calling load() on each file
given as an argument to this program.

Example printing the id of every particle in one file:
python -i particle2numpy.py particle_0.000e+00_s.dc
for key in particle_data:
	print(key)

Example printing the electric field in cell 3 in the first given file:
python -i particle2numpy.py particle_0.000e+00_s.dc
print(bulk_data[3][0][0])

Example printing the velocity of particle with id == 4 from the last given
file in which the particle existed:
python -i particle2numpy.py particle_0.000e+00_s.dc
print(particle_data[4][-1][1])

'''
Returns bulk and particle data of PAMHD particle programs.

If bulk_data or particle_data are None will skip reading
the corresponding data otherwise bulk_data and particle_data
must be dictionaries to which already existing data is
appended from given file. If both are None will do nothing
and return None

Returns the following in a numpy array:
simulation time,
adiabatic index,
vacuum permeability,
ratio of particle temperature to energy (Boltzmann constant).

bulk_data will have cell ids as keys and each value will be
a list of tuples of numpy arrays of electric and magnetic field.
particle_data will have particle ids as keys and each value
will be a list of tuples of numpy arrays of particle position
and velocity.
